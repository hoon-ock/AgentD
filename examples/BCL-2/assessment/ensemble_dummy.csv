O=C(NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N2CCN(CCO)CC2)cc1)c1ccc(N2CCOCC2)c([N+](=O)[O-])c1,"YES. The molecule shows promising drug-like properties with good absorption and distribution. However, there are concerns about liver toxicity and respiratory disease, which should be addressed in further studies.","YES. The molecule shows potential as a drug candidate for BCL-2 targeting, with favorable absorption and distribution properties. However, there are concerns regarding liver injury and respiratory toxicity that need to be addressed in further studies.","YES. The molecule is a potential drug candidate for targeting BCL-2, considering its favorable absorption, distribution, and general properties, despite some concerns about liver toxicity and CYP 2C9 interactions.",Accepted
O=C(NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N2CCOCC2)c([N+](=O)[O-])c1)c1ccc(N2CCNCC2)c(Cl)c1,"NO. Despite favorable absorption and general properties, the high toxicity predictions, especially in AMES mutagenesis and liver injury, present critical risks that disqualify the molecule as a potential drug candidate for targeting BCL-2 in lymphocytic leukemia.","NO. The molecule has potential as a drug candidate due to its favorable absorption and general properties. However, significant concerns about its toxicity (mutagenicity and liver toxicity) and potential for drug-drug interactions due to CYP inhibition make it unsuitable as a drug candidate for BCL-2 targeting in lymphocytic leukemia.","NO. Despite some favorable absorption and general properties, the high toxicity predictions, particularly in AMES mutagenesis and liver injury, present critical risks that outweigh the potential benefits, making it unsuitable as a drug candidate for BCL-2 targeting in lymphocytic leukemia.",Filtered
