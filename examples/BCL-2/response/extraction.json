      "This review provides a comprehensive overview of the extensive preclinical and clinical studies targeting BCL-2 proteins with various BCL-2 proteins inhibitors. Inhibition of BCL-2 family proteins is a rational therapeutic option for malignancies that are dependent on antiapoptotic BCL-2 family proteins. Venetoclax is a highly targeted therapy, binding almost exclusively to BCL2 when used in clinically achievable concentrations. (A) An ... Navitoclax (ABT-263) is a BH3-mimetic drug that targets and inhibits Bcl-xL protein. It significantly reverses fibrosis in patients with scleroderma, a ... Navitoclax is a BH3 mimetic drug that binds to the BH3 domain of BCL-2 anti-apoptotic members. Upon administration, navitoclax binds to the BH3 binding groove ... BCL2 inhibitors are drugs that prompt cancer cells to die by altering the interactions among key proteins within the cells. BCL-X(L)-targeting antibody-drug conjugates are active in preclinical models and mitigate on-mechanism toxicity of small-molecule inhibitors. In 2017, there was a breakthrough, and several new drugs, including venetoclax and selective B cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) inhibitors, seemed to reshape the ... Targeting Bcl-2 family members with the BH3 mimetic AT-101 markedly enhances the therapeutic effects of chemotherapeutic agents in in vitro ... Tools that target Bcl-2's BH4 domain such as BIRD-2 elicit cell death in several cancer cell types and are complementary with BH3 mimetics."
