BCL2 inhibitors are drugs that prompt cancer cells to die by altering the interactions among key proteins within the cells. BCL-X(L)-targeting antibody-drug conjugates are active in preclinical models and mitigate on-mechanism toxicity of small-molecule inhibitors.

Targeting Bcl-2 family members with the BH3 mimetic AT-101 markedly enhances the therapeutic effects of chemotherapeutic agents in in vitro ...

In the context of solid tumors, such as soft tissue sarcoma, the combination has been shown to induce apoptosis synergistically. This is achieved through the transactivation of the pro-apoptotic protein NOXA, which inhibits the anti-apoptotic protein MCL-1, thereby enhancing the efficacy of ABT-199.
