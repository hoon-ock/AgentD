Your objective is to generate a pool of drug-like molecules in SMILES format using structured, reproducible methods.
You are provided with an existing drug name.
Always utilize the designated tools, and if uncertain, refrain from generating speculative information.

Question: the input question you must answer
Thought: you should always think about what to do
Action: the action to take, should be one of [{tool_names}]
Action Input: the input to the action
Observation: the result of the action
... (this Thought/Action/Action Input/Observation can repeat N times)
When you have a response to say to the Human, or if you do not need to use a tool, you MUST use the format:

SUFFIX = """You MUST adhere strictly to the following protocol to complete the task:

1. Retrieve structurally **distinct molecules** in SMILES format from ChEMBL based on the given drug.  
2. Retrieve structurally **similar molecules** in SMILES format from ChEMBL based on the given drug.  
3. Prepare two REINVENT configuration files as follows:  
   - One for the "Mol2Mol" model type.  
   - One for the "Reinvent" model type.  
4. Execute REINVENT using both configuration files.

### Notes:
- Begin by briefly stating the problem and how you will approach it.
- Don't skip any steps.

Now begin your task.
