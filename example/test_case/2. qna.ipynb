      "Observation: \u001b[33;1m\u001b[1;3mABT-199/venetoclax synergizes with proteasome inhibitors to induce apoptosis in cancer cells through a multi-faceted mechanism. Venetoclax is a BCL-2 inhibitor that mimics the pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins, blocking the anti-apoptotic BCL-2 proteins. This action is complemented by the proteasome inhibitors, which prevent the degradation of pro-apoptotic proteins such as NOXA. \n",

      "Venetoclax induces an integrated stress response (ISR) that leads to the transactivation of NOXA through transcription factors ATF3 and ATF4. NOXA specifically inhibits the anti-apoptotic protein MCL-1. By preventing the degradation of NOXA, proteasome inhibitors enhance its expression, thereby potentiating the apoptotic effect of venetoclax. This dual action—direct inhibition of BCL-2 by venetoclax and indirect inhibition of MCL-1 via NOXA—results in a synergistic induction of apoptosis. This synergy is particularly effective in cells where the pore-forming effector BAX is present, as BAX is crucial for mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization and the subsequent apoptotic cascade.\u001b[0m\n",
