Venetoclax induces an integrated stress response, leading to NOXA transactivation via transcription factors ATF3 and ATF4. NOXA inhibits the anti-apoptotic protein MCL-1.

      "ABT-199/venetoclax synergizes with proteasome inhibitors to induce apoptosis in cancer cells through a multi-faceted mechanism. Venetoclax is a BCL-2 inhibitor that mimics the pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins, blocking the anti-apoptotic BCL-2 proteins. This action is complemented by the proteasome inhibitors, which prevent the degradation of pro-apoptotic proteins such as NOXA. \n\nVenetoclax induces an integrated stress response (ISR) that leads to the transactivation of NOXA through transcription factors ATF3 and ATF4. NOXA specifically inhibits the anti-apoptotic protein MCL-1. By preventing the degradation of NOXA, proteasome inhibitors enhance its expression, thereby potentiating the apoptotic effect of venetoclax. This dual action\u2014direct inhibition of BCL-2 by venetoclax and indirect inhibition of MCL-1 via NOXA\u2014results in a synergistic induction of apoptosis. This synergy is particularly effective in cells where the pore-forming effector BAX is present, as BAX is crucial for mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization and the subsequent apoptotic cascade."
